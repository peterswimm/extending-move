# extending-move

Tools for extending the Ableton Move. This project provides a companion webserver that runs alongside the official Move server, accessible at ``move.local:<port>`` (909 by default).

## Features

- **MIDI Upload**
  - Upload and restore Move Sets (.ablbundle)
  - Choose target pad and color

- **Sample Reversal**
  - Create reversed versions of any WAV file
  - Use reversed file in drum kit or sample presets
    
- **Drum Rack Inspector**
  - View all samples in a drum rack preset
  - Download individual samples
  - Create reversed versions directly in the preset
  - Time stretch samples to a target BPM and length with two different algorithms, for melodic or rhythmic content.

- **Drift Preset Editor**
  - Modify any Drift parameter value
  - Manage macro assignments and custom names in the same interface
  - Set custom range values for macro‑controlled parameters
  - Save changes as a new preset file
  - Numeric parameters use sliders with an input field
  - Slider steps are 0.01 for values near ±1 and adapt to the parameter's default precision
  - Enum parameters provide a dropdown of options
  - Create new presets starting from the included Analog Shape example
 
- **MIDI Import**
  - Upload MIDI files to create new sets
  - Choose between Melodic or Drum presets
  - New Sets will be created with either a default Drift or 808 kit for further customization

- **Chord Kit Generation**
  - Create chord variations from any WAV file
  - Includes common chord voicings (Cm9, Fm7, AbMaj7, etc.)
  - Automatic pitch-shifting and normalization
  - Optional Rubber Band processing (using the bundled binary) to keep notes the same length
  - Cached chord samples so downloading or placing a preset reuses the previews
  - Download as `.ablpresetbundle` or place directly on device

- **Sliced Kit Creation**
  - Use a visual slicer to create drum kits from WAV files with up to 16 slices
  - Create equal slices or use transient detection to autoslice to hits
  - Drag custom slice points for each drum pad
  - Download as `.ablpresetbundle` or place directly on device
  - Create a choke group configuration for one-shot behavior, or use Gate and Drum kit style presets

- **Manual Library Refresh**
  - Accessible via ``move.local:<port>/refresh``
  - Force refresh of Move's library cache
  - Useful after manual file changes
  - Uses Move's D-Bus interface
  - Clears cached preset and sample lists used by the web tools
  - File lists are cached for faster loading between scans
    
## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. SSH access to your Move (see [Wiki: Accessing Move](https://github.com/charlesvestal/extending-move/wiki/00--Accessing-Move)). This will be handled by `setup-ssh-and-install-on-move.command` under "Install Everything"
2. Python environment on your Move (should already be present as `python3`)

Note:
These tools are third-party and require SSH access. That means:

 * There’s a real risk (though unlikely) of breaking things, including potentially bricking a device. You are accessing the Move in ways it was not designed to do.
 * Ableton can’t offer individual support if something goes wrong.
 * If issues do arise, the documented restore procedure is the fallback – you use this at their own risk. Information on this procedure can be found in Center Code under [Documentation](https://ableton.centercode.com/project/article/item.html?cap=ecd3942a1fe3405eb27a806608401a0b&arttypeid={e70be312-f44a-418b-bb74-ed1030e3a49a}&artid={C0A2D9E2-D52F-4DEB-8BEE-356B65C8942E}).

### Quick Install (macOS)

#### Install everything

There is a convenience script to set up an SSH key, install the tools, and set the tools' webserver to autostart.

Simply double-click `utility-scripts/setup-ssh-and-install-on-move.command`
Everything that it does can be found in `utility-scripts/setup-ssh-and-install-on-move.sh`

Alternatively, you can install just the tools, or see the "Manual Installation" section below to do it all yourself.

#### Install the tools ONLY

Simply double-click `utility-scripts/install-on-move.command`
Everything that it does can be found in `utility-scripts/install-on-move.sh`

#### Updating

To update, you can use the similar `utility-scripts/update-on-move.command` or `utility-scripts/update-on-move.sh` to copy over the files and restart the webserver. The script accepts `--dev` to skip installing dependencies and `--overwrite` to remove the existing directory before copying.

### Manual Installation

1. Login as the ableton user and install pip:
```bash
ssh ableton@move.local
cd /data/UserData
wget -q -O get-pip.py https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python3 get-pip.py

# Ensure that ~/.bash_profile sources ~/.bashrc so that Bash settings persist on login.
if ! grep -q "\.bashrc" ~/.bash_profile; then
    echo 'if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi' >> ~/.bash_profile
fi

# Add /data/UserData/.local/bin to PATH for this session.
export PATH="/data/UserData/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Persist the PATH update in ~/.bashrc if it's not already present.
if ! grep -q "/data/UserData/.local/bin" ~/.bashrc; then
    echo 'export PATH="/data/UserData/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
fi
```

2. Configure temporary directory:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/tmp
export TMPDIR=~/tmp
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

4. Copy files from your computer to your Move at /data/UserData/extending-move via whatever method you want (i.e. SFTP)

5. SSH to the Move and start the server
```bash
ssh ableton@move.local
cd /data/UserData/extending-move
cp -r /opt/move/HttpRoot/fonts /data/UserData/extending-move/static/
python3 move-webserver.py  # Flask/Jinja web server (default port 909)
```

The server will be accessible at ``http://move.local:<port>``

The chosen port is saved in ``port.conf`` in the project directory.
Edit this file if you need to change the port later. Invalid or
missing values cause the server to fall back to ``909``.

## Utility Scripts

Note: Execute these scripts from your computer, not the Move.

Located in `utility-scripts/`:
- `setup-ssh-and-install-on-move.command`: Walks through setting up an ssh key, installing files, and setting auto-start
- `install-on-move.sh` / `.command`: Content installation
- `update-on-move.sh` / `.command`: Update with latest files (use `--overwrite` to delete the target before copying)
- `restart-webserver.sh`: Restart the webserver


## How to Auto-start on Boot

Note: This does not persist through firmware upgrades. Re-run the command and re-enable the script after upgrading.

When logged in as root (`ssh root@move.local`), create an init.d script with the following command

```bash
cat > /etc/init.d/ableton-startup << 'EOF'
#!/bin/sh
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          ableton-startup
# Required-Start:    $local_fs $network
# Required-Stop:     $local_fs
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 6
# Short-Description: Start Ableton Python script at boot
### END INIT INFO

case "$1" in
  start)
    # adjust this to whatever directory your code lives in:
    cd /data/UserData/extending-move
    # run as the 'ableton' user (drops privileges)
    su - ableton -s /bin/sh -c "cd /data/UserData/extending-move ; python3 move-webserver.py >> startup.log 2>&1 &"
    ;;
  stop)
    if [ -f /data/UserData/extending-move/move-webserver.pid ]; then
      kill $(cat /data/UserData/extending-move/move-webserver.pid)
      rm /data/UserData/extending-move/move-webserver.pid
    fi
    ;;
  restart)
    $0 stop
    sleep 1
    $0 start
    ;;
  status)
    if [ -f /data/UserData/extending-move/move-webserver.pid ] && \
       ps -p $(cat /data/UserData/extending-move/move-webserver.pid) >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      echo "Running"
    else
      echo "Not running"
      exit 1
    fi
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart|status}"
    exit 2
    ;;
esac

exit 0
EOF
chmod +x /etc/init.d/ableton-startup
```

Enable at boot with 
```bash
update-rc.d ableton-startup defaults
```
